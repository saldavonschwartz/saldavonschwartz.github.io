### <a class="toc_item" name="1"></a>RED Patterns:
RED Patterns is a horror, room-scale VR experience for HTC Vive. The project is based on an independent 360 movie called Patterns and I was approached to implement a VR reinterpretation for HTC Vive. I did an original proof of concept in Unity and a subsequent extended version in Unreal Engine 4.

The work was commissioned by [SAT][l1] (Societe des Arts Technologiques, Canada) and co-created with Pierre Friquet, Ando Shah, Mourad Bennacer & Jean-Yves Münch. It was shown at a number of festivals in Europa and the US and won *Best VR Immersion Award* at the [Festival du Nouveau Cinema][l4] in Canada.

Several of the indoor environments were captured from real life using the Matterport depth camera. The experience also has segments of actors’ performances captured with additional depth cameras in tandem with regular film cameras, resulting in point cloud approximations of the actors.

### <a class="toc_item" name="2"></a>Polyworld:

Polyworld is an experiment in gaze-only interaction targeting lower-end GlES2 cardboard devices. The idea was to explore how could the user move fluidly inside a world with a device lacking positional tracking or input besides the Cardboard trigger.

I created the polygonal terrain along with a series of predefined Bezier paths in Blender. Then I imported these to Unity, where I implemented the gaze  and movement logic along the predefined paths.

The result is somewhat reminiscent of the locomotion mechanism in early CD-ROM games like [The 7th Guest][l2].

### <a class="toc_item" name="3"></a>Revolve:

Revolve is a game that works both in VR mode (Cardboard) and monoscopic mode. A spaceship cruises at constant acceleration thru a looping track and the player has to avoid colliding into rotating traps scattered along the track. The challenge in the game stems from the spaceship progressively speeding up and the traps rotating at different periods. There are two kinds of traps: green traps with quarter blockings segment and red traps with half blocking segments.

In VR mode the player must steer the spaceship by slightly tilting their head (head roll equates to spaceship roll) while in mono mode the player tilts their phone instead.

The project required a path following solution for the spaceship to stay on path and travel at arbitrary velocity. This was done as a two step process:

1. Implementing a Blender plugin in Python, which allowed me to create the track as a series of Bezier curves and export the control points.

2. Implementing a Unity component in C# to evaluate the path at arbitrary velocities. The evaluation approach was done according to this [paper][l3].
