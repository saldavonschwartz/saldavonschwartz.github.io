RED Patterns is a psychedelic horror room-scale VR experience for HTC Vive. The project is based on an independent 360 movie called Patterns and I was approached to create a VR reinterpretation for HTC Vive. I did an original proof of concept in Unity and a subsequent extended version in Unreal Engine 4.

The work was commissioned by [SAT][l1] (Societe des Arts Technologiques, Canada) and co-created with Pierre Friquet, Ando Shah, Mourad Bennacer & Jean-Yves Münch. It was shown at a number of festivals in Europe and the US and won the *Immersion Award* at the [45th Festival du Nouveau Cinema][l4] in Canada.

Several of the indoor environments were captured from real life using Matterport depth cameras. The experience also has segments of actors’ performances captured with additional depth cameras synched to RGB cameras, resulting in point cloud approximations of the actors.
