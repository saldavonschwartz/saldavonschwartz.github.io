### <a class="toc_item" name="1"></a>About:

NNKit is an extensible framework for building and training neural networks. It provides a collection of nodes to implement dynamic net topologies as well as optimizers to train these networks and a few other helper algorithms for things such as mini batch partitioning.

The motivation for creating my own framework as opposed to using an existing one like PyTorch or Tensorflow was to study neural networks from the ground up, both from a theoretical and practical perspective.

### <a class="toc_item" name="2"></a>Computation Graphs:

NNKit is based around the concept of computation graphs. A computation graph is a general way of describing an arbitrary computation or function as a composition of individual operations.

For example, Figure 1 shows a hypothetical 3-class classifier as a neural network. The network has a 3-3 topology, meaning 2 layers (excluding inputs) and 3 units per layer. As is customary in neural net diagrams, each unit or 'neuron' is assumed to perform a weighted linear combination followed by a nonlinear transformation (i.e.: the activation function). In this example the first layer uses ReLU activations and the second uses Softmax, so outputs of the network can be interpreted as the probability that an input maps to one of three classes. Each layer also has a dummy constant input of 1 to add a *bias* term into each layer's linear combination.

{% include latex/nnkit/nn.md %}

In NNKit, the same classifier would instead be described as a vectorized computation graph (Figure 2). This representation has two main differences with the one in Figure 1:

* The neuron computation is broken down into its constituent operations: multiplication, addition of bias and nonlinear activation. This means a layer is made up of a sequence of operations. A general computation graph would also decompose activations into primitive operations but I chose to implement these as atomic operations.

* There are no individual neurons nor explicit layers. Instead, there are variables and operations and combinations of these allow thinking of blocks of computation as implicit layers with *shapes* such as 2-in to 3-out. In terms of implementation, computations equivalent to those of multiple neurons in a layer are then packed into tensors and carried out in parallel.

{% include latex/nnkit/graph.md %}

### <a class="toc_item" name="3"></a>Variables, Operators and Implicit Dynamic Graphs:

NNKit graphs are made up of two types of nodes: **variables** (`NetVar` class) and **operators** (`NetOp` class).

* **variables** hold a value in their `data` property and this value can be arbitrarily set. They also have a `g` attribute (for gradient) which after a backprop pass holds the gradient of the computation graph output w.r.t the variable. Examples of variables are inputs to a graph or parameters such as weights and biases.

* **operators** are `NetVar` subclasses whose value is automatically (and only once) derived on instance initialization from their operands, which are other variables passed to the initializer. Examples of operators are multiplication, addition, ReLU and Softmax.

The operator initialization mechanism has two implications:

#### Graphs are Implicit:

There is no graph class in the framework. Instead, as operators are instantiated with other nodes as arguments they keep references to their parents, implicitly defining a dependency graph (Figure 2) from which to later back propagate gradients. This being said, it is easy to create convenience wrapper classes for graphs. The framework for instance includes a `FFN` (feed-forward network) convenience class.

#### Graphs are Dynamic:

Because operators compute their value only once on initialization, in order to compute successive forward passes for a graph one must keep parameter variables around and continuously re-instantiate operator nodes, which upon instantiation will hold the value of the forward pass up to that point in their `data` property. This mechanism makes graphs dynamic, since their topology can change between passes depending on which operators are instantiated. This is very useful for sequential models of varying input length for example.

### <a class="toc_item" name="4"></a>Forward and Backward Passes:

Eq. 1 defines the 3-class classifier for earlier and Eq. 2 shows its decomposition into individual operators and variables:

{% include latex/nnkit/eq1.md %}

{% include latex/nnkit/eq2.md %}

Code 1 shows NNKit code equivalent to Eq. 2, where arbitrary values have been assigned to the variables.

```python
import nnkit as nn

# Variables:
x = nn.NetVar([1,2])
w1 = nn.NetVar([[3,4,5], [6,7,8]])
b1 = nn.NetVar([1,2,3])
w2 = nn.NetVar([[1,2,3], [3,4,5], [6,7,8]])
b2 = nn.NetVar([1,2,3])

# Layer 1 Operators:
mul1 = nn.Multiply(x, w1)
add1 = nn.Add(mul1, b1)
relu1 = nn.ReLU(add1)

# Layer 2 Operators:
mul2 = nn.Multiply(relu1, w2)
add2 = nn.Add(mul2, b2)
smax2 = nn.SoftMax(add2)
```

#### Forward Pass:
As mentioned before, all nodes have a `data` property which holds the value of the node. In the case of operators this is the value of the forward pass of the graph as constructed up to that point. So the `data` of the last operator in a graph holds the value of the graph's output (Figure 3).

{% include latex/nnkit/forward.md %}

#### Backward Pass:
The backward pass is computed by calling `back()` on any operator. This causes each operator to apply chain rule and compute the gradient of its `data` w.r.t. its parents (accessible thru each node's `g`). Since it's possible to call `back()` on any operator, it's possible to do backpropagation for a subgraph of a larger graph, though typically `back()` is just called on the last node in a graph.

{% include latex/nnkit/backward.md %}

Eq. 3 shows the forward and backward pass computations at the operator level, for a `Multiply` node implementing a 2-in, 3-out layer (equivalent to the output of three neurons). Code 2 shows the implementation of this node in NNKit and hints to how it's possible to extend the framework with additional operators.

{% include latex/nnkit/eq3.md %}

```python
class Multiply(NetOp):
    """Multiplication.

    y = xw
    """
    def __init__(self, x, w):
        """
        :param x: NetVar: input 1.

        :param w: NetVar: input 2.
        """
        super().__init__(
            x.data @ w.data,
            x, w
        )

    def _back(self, x, w):
        x.g += self.g @ w.data.T
        w.g += x.data.T @ self.g
        super()._back()
```

### <a class="toc_item" name="5"></a>Optimizers:

Optimizers are algorithms that minimize some notion of distance or error between a graph's output (i.e.: a model's hypothesis) and a target. An optimization step consists of nudging model *parameters* (denoted $$\theta$$) in the direction opposite of the gradient of the network output w.r.t. the parameters. In NNKit a parameter is simply any `NetVar` passed to an optimizer for which derivatives have been computed.

As an example, Eq 4. defines **Gradient Descent with momentum** and Code 3 shows this optimizer as implemented in NNKit.

{% include latex/nnkit/eq4.md %}

```python
class GD(Optimizer):
    """Gradient descent with optional momentum.

    Implements the following update for each parameter p:

    m = β1m + (1-β1)df/dp
    p = p - αm

    Attributes:
    . learnRate: α ∈ [0,1]
    how big of an adjustment each parameter undergoes during an optimization step.

    . momentum: β1 ∈ [0,1]
    over how many samples the exponential moving average m takes place.
    If set to 0 momentum is disabled and the algorithm becomes simply gradient descent.
    """
    def __init__(self, params):
        super().__init__(params)
        self.momentum = 0.9
        self.m = [np.zeros_like(p.data) for p in params]

    def step(self):
        for i, p in enumerate(self.params):
            self.m[i] = self.momentum * self.m[i] + (1 - self.momentum) * p.g
            p.data -= self.learnRate * self.m[i]
            p.reset()
```
<figcaption><strong>Code 3:</strong> NNKit implementation of gradient descent with momentum.</figcaption>

NNKit currently implements **Gradient Descent with momentum** and **Adam** (which degenerates to **RMSProp** if momentum is set to 0.). Code 4 shows an example very similar to the one in Code 1 but using the `FFN` convenience class along with an optimizer and a loss node. It's worth noting that even though the `FFN` class has a `vars` property, the network's parameters could have just been declared outside the network instance and passed directly to the optimizer.

```python
import nnkit as nn

# 1. input:
x = nn.NetVar([1, 2])

# 2. initialize (2,3,3) network:
net = nn.FFN(
    (nn.Multiply, nn.rand2(2,3)),
    (nn.Add, nn.rand2(3)),
    (nn.ReLU,),
    (nn.Multiply, nn.rand2(3,3)),
    (nn.Add, nn.rand2(3)),
    (nn.SoftMax, )
)

# 3. create optimizer and pass parameters to optimize:
optimizer = nn.GD(net.vars)

# 4. add loss node at the end of the net to optimize against:
target = nn.NetVar([0, 0, 1])
net.topology.append((nn.CELoss, target))

# 5. optimize (a.k.a. train, a.k.a. learn):
loss = float('inf')
while loss > 0.01:
    print(loss)
    # 5.a forward pass: instantiate all operators (variables are persisted from step 2):
    loss = net(x).item()

    # 5.b backprop: compute gradient w.r.t. loss:
    net.back()

    # 5.c optimize parameters:
    optimizer.step()

# 6. remove loss node. Network is trained and ready for testing / performing.
net.topology.pop()
```
