This is an **ongoing** CUDA implementation of a path tracer, largely based on Peter Shirleyâ€™s *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* series of tutorials plus other resources.

Features currently implemented are:

- Materials: Difuse, Metallic Dielectric and Emissive.
- Area lights.
- Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) partitioning.
- Depth of Field.
- Geometry: spheres and planes.

Future features will include:

- Arbitrary geometry (i.e.: FBX, OBJ).
- Probabilistic sampling.
- Deep-Learing-based supersampling.
